# OPC Extension Authoring Guide

> Canonical guide for writing third-party OPC extensions. Self-contained — if

> need to ship your first extension.

## 0. Prerequisites — how to get `opc-harness`

This guide uses `opc-harness` as if it were on your `PATH`. Two ways to make
that true:

1. **npm install** (preferred, same package the README teaches):

   ```bash
   npm i -g @touchskyer/opc           # or: pnpm add -g / yarn global add
   opc-harness --help                  # sanity check — prints usage to stderr
   ```

   The npm package ships the `opc-harness` binary alongside the `/opc` slash
   commands. Both invoke the same Node script — they are not two products.

2. **Run from a repo checkout** (no global install — handy for hacking on
   the harness itself):

   ```bash
   node /path/to/opc/bin/opc-harness.mjs --help
   alias opc-harness='node /path/to/opc/bin/opc-harness.mjs'  # optional
   ```

   Any command in this guide that starts with `opc-harness …` can be
   rewritten as `node bin/opc-harness.mjs …`.

Sanity check: `opc-harness` with no arguments (or `--help`) prints the full
command list to stderr and exits 0. If you see `command not found`, you
either skipped the install step or your shell's `PATH` doesn't include the
global npm bin dir (`npm bin -g`).

### `~/.opc/` bootstrap

Extensions live under `~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/<ext-name>/`. Rules:

- `~/.opc/` itself does **not** need to exist ahead of time. If the
  extensions dir is missing, the loader treats it as "zero extensions
  installed" and moves on (unless a required extension was declared — then
  it FATALs).
- Nothing else in `~/.opc/` is required for extensions. The optional
  per-user `~/.opc/config.json` (documented in the README) is read by
  `opc-harness config resolve` for global defaults, but is not part of the
  extension-discovery contract.
- To relocate the scan root, set `OPC_EXTENSIONS_DIR=/custom/path`.
- To bypass the scan entirely during development, point
  `opc-harness extension-test --ext <abs-path>` at a single directory —
  that command loads your extension directly without touching
  `~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/`.

---

## 1. What is an OPC extension?

An OPC extension is a **directory on disk** containing a `hook.mjs` ES module
and a small `ext.json` manifest. When OPC runs a task pipeline, it scans
`~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/` (or whatever `OPC_EXTENSIONS_DIR` points at), dynamically
imports each `hook.mjs`, and invokes named hooks at well-defined call sites
inside the orchestrator — appending text to role prompts, adding findings to
evaluator verdicts, running side-effectful checks during executor nodes, and
emitting artifact files into the current run directory.

Extensions are **capability-gated**: an extension declares what it provides
(e.g. `visual-consistency-check@1`), each node in the flow template declares
what capabilities it requires, and the core only fires your hooks when your
`provides` overlap the node's requirements. An extension with no capability
match is silently skipped — not an error, just not this node's concern.

Failures are **isolated and observable**. Any hook that throws, times out, or
returns the wrong shape is recorded to a failure sidecar (`extension-failures.json`
+ a rendered `extension-failures.md`). After N consecutive failures a per-process
circuit breaker disables the extension for the remainder of the run. Healthy
siblings keep executing. This is the core contract: **your extension cannot
take down the pipeline.**

### 1.1 Execution model

This section is **SemVer-stable contract** — extensions may rely on it.

- **In-process dynamic `import()`.** Each `hook.mjs` is loaded into the same
  Node process as the harness. There is no worker, no fork, no sandbox. Your
  hook runs with full Node privileges — `fs`, `child_process`, `process.env`,
  the module cache, all of it. `process.exit()` in your hook **will** kill
  the harness; don't do that.
- **Sequential per call site.** Inside a single call site
  (`firePromptAppend`, `fireVerdictAppend`, `fireExecuteRun`,
  `fireArtifactEmit`), extensions are invoked one at a time with `await`.
  Extension B does not start until extension A has resolved, thrown, or
  timed out. One extension's throw does **not** abort siblings — the core
  catches, records, and moves to the next.
- **Deterministic ordering = alphabetical by directory name.** The loader
  sorts discovered extensions alphabetically before loading. Outputs from
  `promptAppend` are concatenated in that order with `\n\n` separators;
  findings from `verdictAppend` are merged in that order; artifacts from
  `artifactEmit` are written in that order into per-extension subdirs so
  there is no name collision across extensions (see §5.5). You can override
  the front of the order via `config.extensionOrder: ["a", "b", …]`; any
  extensions not named there fall to alphabetical tail order.
- **No cross-call-site ordering guarantee.** `promptAppend` vs
  `verdictAppend` vs `artifactEmit` run at different pipeline phases in
  different CLI invocations — never assume one finished before another
  started unless they are the same phase.
- **`ctx` is a shared mutable reference — do not mutate it.** The core
  passes the same object to every matched extension without freezing or
  cloning it. If extension A does `ctx.task = ctx.task.toUpperCase()`,
  extension B (which runs after A) will see the upper-cased value. Treat
  `ctx` as read-only; mutating it is undefined behavior and a future
  minor-version change may `Object.freeze` it to enforce this.
- **Cooperative timeouts.** The `HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` guard races your
  hook's promise against a `setTimeout` (see §7.1). If your hook times
  out, the core rejects the awaited promise and continues — but any
  in-flight subprocesses, network requests, or unresolved promises **you**
  started keep running in the background. Always pipe an
  `AbortController` / `AbortSignal.timeout` into `spawn` / `fetch` /
  Playwright calls so they clean themselves up.

### 1.2 Hook name mapping (camelCase ↔ kebab+dot)

The same five hooks go by two names:

| camelCase export (§5)  | Kebab+dot canonical name (§8, §9, logs) |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `promptAppend`         | `prompt.append`                          |
| `verdictAppend`        | `verdict.append`                         |
| `executeRun`           | `execute.run`                            |
| `artifactEmit`         | `artifact.emit`                          |
| `startupCheck`         | `startup.check`                          |

Rules:

- Export your hook under **either** the camelCase name (recommended) **or**
  the kebab+dot name via `export { fn as "prompt.append" }`. Both are
  normalized to the same internal `hooks["prompt.append"]` slot.
- If you export **both** forms, the **kebab+dot form wins** (it is assigned
  after the camelCase form in the normalizer).
- **Unknown exports are silently ignored.** Exporting a function named
  `prommptAppend` (typo) or `onPrompt` will not error, will not warn — the
  hook just never fires. If your hello-world's hook never runs, grep
  your export name against the table above first.
- Failure sidecar, stderr logs, and `--hook` CLI flag all use the
  **kebab+dot** form. Grep `prompt.append`, not `promptAppend`, when
  chasing issues in logs.

## 2. Quickstart (5 minutes)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/hello-world
cd ~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/hello-world
```

**`ext.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "hello-world",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Minimal promptAppend extension — injects a greeting.",
  "meta": {
    "provides": ["context-enrichment@1"]
  }
}
```

**`hook.mjs`**

```js
export const meta = {
  name: "hello-world",
  provides: ["context-enrichment@1"],
  description: "Injects a greeting section into prompts."
};

export async function promptAppend(ctx) {
  if (!ctx || !ctx.task) return "";
  return `## Hello\n\nWorking on: ${ctx.task.slice(0, 80)}\n`;
}
```

**Test it without running a full pipeline:**

```bash
opc-harness extension-test \
  --ext ~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/hello-world \
  --all-hooks \
  --context '{"task":"build a login page","nodeCapabilities":["context-enrichment@1"]}'
```

You should see a `✅ prompt.append` line in stdout with the rendered section.
That's it — you've written, installed, and validated an extension.

---

## 3. Anatomy of an extension

### 3.1 Directory layout

```
~/.claude/skills/opc-extension/
  my-ext/
    ext.json         # manifest (name, version, description, meta)
    hook.mjs         # ES module exporting hooks + meta (REQUIRED)
    prompt.md        # optional static markdown (read into ext.promptMd at load)
    …                # anything else (package.json, node_modules, tests) is yours
```

Only two rules the loader enforces:

1. The subdirectory name **must not** start with `.` (dotfiles are filtered —
   `.git`, `.DS_Store`, etc.).
2. The subdirectory **must** contain a file literally named `hook.mjs`.
   Anything else is ignored as "not an extension."

The directory name is the canonical extension name (`ext.name` in logs,
failure records, and artifact subdir `ext-<name>/`).

### 3.2 `ext.json` fields

```json
{
  "name": "memex-recall",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "One-line summary of what this extension does.",
  "meta": {
    "provides": ["context-enrichment@1"],
    "compatibleCapabilities": ["verification@1", "execute@1"]
  }
}
```

`ext.json` is **descriptive only** — the loader reads `meta` from your
`hook.mjs` exports, not from JSON. `ext.json` exists so humans (and package
indexes) can see what the extension does without eval'ing JS. Keep `meta`
here in sync with `hook.mjs` as a matter of discipline.

In particular, `name` in `ext.json` is **purely cosmetic** — the directory
name always wins (§3.1). The `_starter/` template omits `name` deliberately
(no field is better than a stale field); the `memex-recall` example includes
it for human skim-readability. Either style is legal. If you include it,
keep it in sync with the directory name.

### 3.3 `hook.mjs` export shapes

Three shapes are accepted. Pick the first one (named exports) unless you have
a reason not to.

**A. Named exports (recommended):**

```js
export const meta = { name: "my-ext", provides: ["foo@1"], description: "…" };
export async function promptAppend(ctx) { /* … */ }
export async function verdictAppend(ctx) { /* … */ }
export async function executeRun(ctx)    { /* … */ }
export async function artifactEmit(ctx)  { /* … */ }
export async function startupCheck(ctx)  { /* … */ }
```

> `meta.name` is **not read** by the loader — the canonical extension name
> comes from the directory basename (§3.1). Omit it; the `_starter/`
> template at `examples/extensions/_starter/hook.mjs` does. The quickstart
> and §3.3 examples still include `name:` for historical reasons; both
> styles load identically.

**B. Kebab-case named exports:**

```js
export const meta = { /* … */ };
export { promptAppendFn as "prompt.append", verdictAppendFn as "verdict.append" };
```

**C. Legacy default-export (still supported):**

```js
export default {
  meta: { name: "my-ext", provides: ["foo@1"] },
  hooks: {
    "prompt.append":  async (ctx) => "…",
    "verdict.append": async (ctx) => [/* findings */],
    "startup.check":  async (ctx) => { /* throw to abort load */ },
    "execute.run":    async (ctx) => { /* side effect */ },
    "artifact.emit":  async (ctx) => [{ name: "foo.txt", content: "…" }],
  },
};
```

All three shapes normalize to the same internal `{ hooks: { ... } }` object
via `normalizeHook()`.

## 4. Capabilities & routing

### 4.1 Versioning format

Capability identifiers are strings matching `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*@[1-9]\d*$/`:

- Lowercase ASCII letter start (`a-z`)
- Then lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens
- Literal `@`
- Positive integer version (1, 2, …). No leading zeros. No `@0`.

Valid: `visual-check@1`, `a11y-audit@2`, `perf-check@10`.
Invalid: `VisualCheck@1` (uppercase), `foo@0` (zero), `foo@01` (leading zero),
`foo` (missing version — see auto-upgrade below).

**No semver.** Versions are **integer generations**, not semver ranges.
`foo@1` matches `foo@1` only; `foo@1` does **not** match `foo@2` under any
rule. There is no `^1`, no `>=1`, no `1.x` — writing `"foo@^1"` or
`"foo@1.0"` in `provides` / `compatibleCapabilities` is lint-FAIL
`invalid-shape` (§4.6). To support multiple generations, list them
individually:

```js
provides: ["visual-check@2"],
compatibleCapabilities: ["visual-check@1"],  // widen to the older gen
```

### 4.2 Bare-name auto-upgrade

A bare name like `foo` (matching `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`) is **auto-upgraded** to
`foo@1` at normalization time. The first time each bare token is seen in a
process, a WARN is written to stderr:

```
[opc] WARN: capability 'foo' missing version suffix — auto-upgrading to 'foo@1'.
Declare 'foo@1' explicitly to silence this.
```

The warning fires **once per bare token per process**. If you see it, add the
`@1` suffix in your `meta.provides` and your flow template's `nodeCapabilities`.

### 4.3 `meta.provides`

Array of capability strings this extension provides. Examples:

```js
export const meta = {
  provides: ["visual-consistency-check@1"],            // one capability
  provides: ["a11y@1", "color-contrast@1"],            // multiple
  provides: [],                                        // none — startupCheck runs, hooks never fire
};
```

`meta.provides = []` is **legal and useful** for extensions whose entire
purpose is `startupCheck` (e.g. asserting an env var is set at load time).

### 4.4 `meta.compatibleCapabilities`

Array of additional capability strings this extension **also matches** without
claiming them as its canonical output. Useful during capability-version
migrations:

```js
export const meta = {
  provides: ["visual-check@2"],                // canonical
  compatibleCapabilities: ["visual-check@1"],  // still fire for @1 nodes
};
```

A node requiring `visual-check@1` will match this extension; so will a node
requiring `visual-check@2`.

### 4.5 Routing rule

When a hook call site runs, the core computes "should I fire this extension?"
as follows:

1. Read `ctx.nodeCapabilities` (array of strings the current node requires).
2. Normalize both `ext.meta.provides ∪ ext.meta.compatibleCapabilities` and
   `nodeCapabilities` via the `name@N` rule.
3. Fire if the sets intersect. Skip otherwise.

Edge cases:

- `nodeCapabilities` is missing / empty / not an array → **no** extensions
  fire for that node.
- `ext.meta.provides` is empty AND `compatibleCapabilities` is empty → the
  extension never fires from any node.
- Node requires a capability that **no installed extension provides** →
  **silent no-op**. There is no "unmet capability" error. The node
  proceeds with whatever the built-in roles produce. Debug by running
  `opc-harness config resolve` (confirms the loaded extensions and their
  provides) plus `opc-harness extension-test --ext <path>` (confirms your
  extension lints clean and exports the expected provides).
- Matching is **case-sensitive exact string equality** after normalization.
  A capability that fails `lintCapability` (e.g. `Foo@1`) never matches
  anything — the lint WARN in §4.6 is your only signal.

### 4.6 Lint

`opc-harness extension-test` runs `lintCapability` on every entry of
`meta.provides` and `meta.compatibleCapabilities` before invoking hooks.
Possible outcomes per entry:

| Result                    | Meaning                                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `ok: true, versioned`     | Canonical `name@N` form — no warning.                 |
| `ok: true, bare`          | Bare `name` — valid, but will WARN at runtime.        |
| `ok: false, not-a-string` | Entry is not a string — lint FAIL.                    |
| `ok: false, empty`        | Entry is `""` — lint FAIL.                            |
| `ok: false, invalid-shape`| Doesn't match either regex — lint FAIL.               |

Lint failures print a `[lint] ⚠️` line to stderr but **do not block** hook
execution — the harness continues and reports per-hook pass/fail separately.

**Run 5 additions:**

- `--lint` — run lint checks only, do not invoke any hook. Exits 0 even on
  lint issues (WARNs go to stderr). Useful in CI as a pre-commit check:

  ```bash
  opc-harness extension-test --ext ./my-ext --lint
  ```

  Besides capability-shape lint, `--lint` also detects **hook/provides
  mismatch**:
    - `provides` declared but zero hooks implemented → the extension loads
      but never fires.
    - Hooks implemented but `provides` is empty → `extensionMatches()` skips
      the extension on every node.
  Soft overlap between `provides` and `compatibleCapabilities` (legitimate
  v1→v2 migration) is NOT a mismatch.

- `--lint-strict` — same as `--lint`, but exits 1 if any `[lint]` WARN is
  printed. Use this in CI when you want lint issues to break the build:

  ```bash
  opc-harness extension-test --ext ./my-ext --lint-strict
  ```

- `--fixture-dir <path>` — copy a directory into a fresh tmpdir (cleaned up
  on exit) and set `ctx.flowDir`/`ctx.runDir` to it. Use this when your
  hook reads files from `ctx.flowDir` (design tokens, handshakes, prior
  eval files) and you want a realistic sandbox without polluting your repo.
  Overrides any `flowDir`/`runDir` passed via `--context`. Symlinks in the
  source are **dereferenced** — the sandbox contains only plain files/dirs,
  so a fixture containing a symlink to `/etc/passwd` cannot escape the
  sandbox.

  ```bash
  opc-harness extension-test \
    --ext ./my-ext --hook prompt.append \
    --fixture-dir test/fixtures/sample-flow-dir
  ```

- **Unknown-flag guard** — any `--foo` argument not in the known-flag set
  (e.g. a typo like `--fixturedir`) is rejected with a loud error. Previously
  `getFlag` silently ignored these, which caused fixture-dir typos to write
  into the user's repo.

### 4.7 Canonical core capabilities

The built-in flow templates (`flow-templates.mjs`) stamp a fixed set of
capability strings onto their nodes. Declare `compatibleCapabilities` with
these strings if you want your extension to auto-fire on stock OPC flows —
don't cargo-cult from other examples.

| Capability string               | Emitted by (built-in node)                        | Phase        |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `code-quality-check@1`          | `build-verify.code-review`, `full-stack.code-review` | review    |
| `visual-consistency-check@1`    | `code-review`, `acceptance` nodes                 | review       |
| `user-simulation@1`             | `acceptance`, `e2e-user`, `post-launch-sim`       | review/execute |
| `security-check@1`              | `audit`                                           | review       |
| `a11y-check@1`                  | `audit`                                           | review       |
| `verification@1`                | generic verification slot (widely used by examples) | review     |
| `design-review@1`               | generic design-review slot                        | review       |
| `execute@1`                     | generic executor slot                             | execute      |
| `context-enrichment@1`          | any node the flow stamps with it                  | prompt       |

Also widely used by the `examples/extensions/*` set as a "match all three
generic review/execute nodes" triple: `["verification@1",
"design-review@1", "execute@1"]` (see `memex-recall` §10.1,
`session-logex`, `lint-prompt-length`). User-defined flows can stamp
arbitrary capability strings — these are just the ones shipped.

If you target a node that stamps a capability **not** in this table,
your `compatibleCapabilities` must list it explicitly. The silent-no-op
rule (§4.5) means a capability typo produces no runtime signal.

---

## 5. The hooks

All hooks receive a single `ctx` argument and are called with `await`.
Synchronous hooks are fine (the core wraps with `Promise.resolve`).

There are **five** hooks in total: the four that fire per-node during a
pipeline (`promptAppend`, `verdictAppend`, `executeRun`, `artifactEmit`)
plus `startupCheck` which runs once at load time (§5.6). See the name
mapping table in §1.2 for the camelCase ↔ kebab+dot correspondence used
across logs and CLI flags.

### 5.1 `ctx` shape

The exact fields passed depend on which CLI command / call site invokes the
hook, but the stable subset all hooks can rely on is:

```js
{
  node: "build-login",                       // current node id (string)
  role: "builder" | "evaluator" | "executor",// current role
  task: "Build a login page with email+password",  // task description
  flowDir: "/abs/path/to/.harness",          // root of the harness dir
  runDir:  "/abs/path/to/.harness/nodes/build-login/run-2026-04-19T…",
  devServerUrl: "http://localhost:5173",     // may be "" if none configured
  nodeCapabilities: ["visual-check@1"],      // the node's required capabilities
}
```

Additional fields may be present depending on the call site (e.g. `artifacts`,
`handshake` may be populated by the orchestrator when stamping). **Always
defensively destructure** — treat any field as potentially missing:

```js
export async function promptAppend(ctx) {
  const task = ctx?.task ?? "";
  const runDir = ctx?.runDir;
  if (!runDir) return "";   // not safe to write files without runDir
  // …
}
```

**`ctx.task` is the task description, not the assembled prompt.** It is the
first line of the node's `acceptance-criteria.md` (e.g. `"Build a login page
with email+password"`), set by `readTaskFromAC` in `ext-commands.mjs`. There
is **no** `ctx.assembledPrompt` — a hook cannot see the concatenation of
every extension's `promptAppend` output. To bound prompt growth, either
measure the inputs (`ctx.task`) or emit the finding from inside
`promptAppend` itself as a side-channel `process.stderr.write` line.

**`ctx.task` type guarantee holds in the pipeline only.** In production
pipeline commands (`prompt-context`, `extension-verdict`, `extension-artifact`)
`ctx.task` is always a string — `""` when `acceptance-criteria.md` is absent.
Under `extension-test --context <json>`, the JSON is passed through verbatim,
so your hook may receive `task: undefined`, `task: 42`, `task: [...]`, etc.
For any schema-typed field you read, guard with a `typeof` check, not just
`??`:

```js
const task = typeof ctx?.task === "string" ? ctx.task : "";
```

### 5.2 `promptAppend(ctx)` — prompt augmentation

**Fires when:** the orchestrator is building the role prompt for a node that
requires at least one of your capabilities.

**Signature:** `async (ctx) => string | null | undefined`

**Expected return:** a markdown string. It is concatenated (with `\n\n`
separators) to the other extensions' outputs and appended to the role prompt.

**Graceful-empty value:** return `""`, `null`, or `undefined`. Any of these
causes the core to skip your contribution silently (no failure recorded).

**Wrong-shape penalty:** returning anything other than `string | null |
undefined | ""` records a `bad-return` failure and ignores the value.

**Example:**

```js
export async function promptAppend(ctx) {
  const notes = await fetchRelevantNotes(ctx?.task).catch(() => []);
  if (notes.length === 0) return "";
  const items = notes.map(n => `- ${n.title}`).join("\n");
  return `## Relevant prior notes\n\n${items}\n`;
}
```

**CLI:** `opc-harness prompt-context --node <id> --role <role> --dir <harness-dir>`
fires `promptAppend` and prints `{ append, applied, nodeCapabilities }` as JSON.

### 5.3 `verdictAppend(ctx)` — evaluator findings

**Fires when:** the evaluator role runs `opc-harness extension-verdict` (or
the equivalent orchestrator hook) for a node requiring your capabilities.

**Signature:** `async (ctx) => Finding[] | null | undefined`

**Finding shape:**

```js
{
  severity: "error" | "warning" | "info",   // required
  category: "a11y" | "contrast" | "…",      // required string
  message:  "Button contrast ratio 3.1:1 below WCAG AA 4.5:1",  // required string
  file:     "src/Login.tsx",                // optional
}
```

**Legacy shape** also normalized: `{ text: "[tag] category: message", emoji: "🔴"|"🟡"|"🔵", file? }`.

**Expected return:** an array of findings. An empty array is fine. Each
finding is rendered into `<runDir>/eval-extensions.md`:

```
🔴 a11y: Missing alt text on hero image in src/Home.tsx
🟡 contrast: Link color 4.2:1 (target 4.5:1)
🔵 extensions: No extension findings
```

The renderer maps `severity` → emoji with this exact table (see
`extensions.mjs` `fireVerdictAppend` around line 556):

| `severity` string | Rendered emoji |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `"error"`         | 🔴             |
| `"warning"`       | 🟡             |
| `"info"`          | 🔵             |
| anything else     | 🔵 (fallback)  |

The emoji is applied **only** by the pipeline renderer when it writes
`<runDir>/eval-extensions.md`. The `extension-test` CLI prints the literal
severity word instead (`warning`, `error`, `info`) with no emoji — see §9.
The same table drives the `extension-failures.md` sidecar (§8.2).

**Graceful-empty value:** `null`, `undefined`, or `[]`. All skipped silently.

**Wrong-shape penalty:** a non-array return records `bad-return` and is
ignored. Individual findings that don't match either shape are **silently
dropped with no failure record** — no `extension-failures.md` entry, no
stderr line. The finding simply never appears in `eval-extensions.md`. If
your finding vanishes, grep your payload against this checklist first:

- `severity` must be exactly one of the strings `"error"`, `"warning"`,
  `"info"` (lowercase, full word — `"warn"`, `"ERROR"`, `"err"` all drop).
- `category` must be a non-empty string (free-form lowercase identifier;
  any unknown category renders identically to known ones).
- `message` must be a string (empty string technically passes the shape
  check but renders as a blank line — don't).
- `file` is optional, must be a string when present. A wrong-typed `file`
  (e.g. number) causes the whole finding to drop, not just the field.
- `null` / `undefined` entries in the array drop.
- Extra fields are preserved on the object but only `severity`, `category`,
  `message`, `file` are rendered.

The dropped-finding trail is **visible only through what's missing**. When
in doubt, add a `process.stderr.write('[my-ext] emitting finding:', f)`
just before the return to confirm the shape.

**Example:**

```js
export async function verdictAppend(ctx) {
  if (!ctx?.runDir) return [];
  const findings = [];
  try {
    const report = await runAxeAudit(ctx.devServerUrl);
    for (const v of report.violations) {
      findings.push({
        severity: v.impact === "critical" ? "error" : "warning",
        category: "a11y",
        message: `${v.id}: ${v.description}`,
      });
    }
  } catch {
    return [];  // graceful degrade — see §6
  }
  return findings;
}
```

### 5.4 `executeRun(ctx)` — side-effectful verification

**Fires when:** the executor role runs `opc-harness extension-artifact` for a
node requiring your capabilities. Runs **before** `artifactEmit`.

**Signature:** `async (ctx) => any`

**Return value:** accepted but not enforced. Typical uses:
- Run Playwright to exercise the built UI
- Hit a local API endpoint
- Crawl the dev server and collect screenshots (save them yourself, or return
  them from `artifactEmit` — see §5.5)

**Graceful-empty value:** any value (or nothing). Unlike prompt/verdict, there
is no "empty" signal here — the return is not consumed.

**Wrong-shape penalty:** none. The only way `executeRun` gets a failure
record is by throwing or timing out.

**Example:**

```js
export async function executeRun(ctx) {
  if (!ctx?.devServerUrl) return;
  const res = await fetch(`${ctx.devServerUrl}/health`, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) })
    .catch(() => null);
  if (!res || !res.ok) {
    // Side effect only: log. No return value needed.
    process.stderr.write(`[my-ext] dev server not healthy, skipping\n`);
  }
}
```

### 5.5 `artifactEmit(ctx)` — write files to the run dir

**Fires when:** the executor role runs `opc-harness extension-artifact`.
Runs **after** `executeRun` in the same command.

**Signature:** `async (ctx) => Array<{ name: string, content: string | Buffer | ArrayBufferView }> | null | undefined`

**Each item:**
- `name` — a **plain basename** (no `/`, no `..`, not empty, not `.`).
  Anything that fails `path.basename()` equality or lands on these
  sentinels is skipped with a stderr WARN and no file is written.
  Note: on POSIX, backslash `\` is treated as a literal filename
  character — `foo\bar.png` becomes a single weirdly-named file, not a
  subdir. Sanitize upstream if you generate names from page titles /
  URLs / user input.
- `content` — accepted types (anything else is skipped with WARN, no
  failure record):
  - `string` (written as UTF-8)
  - `Buffer`
  - Any `ArrayBufferView` — `Uint8Array`, `Int8Array`, `DataView`, other
    TypedArrays. Modern APIs (`crypto.subtle.digest`, `TextEncoder`,
    Playwright `page.screenshot()`, `sharp(x).toBuffer()`) all return
    types that satisfy this.
  - **Not** supported: raw `ArrayBuffer` (wrap it: `new Uint8Array(buf)`),
    `Blob`, `ReadableStream`, `AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>`, `Promise<Buffer>`
    (await it first — `content: await page.screenshot()`, not
    `content: page.screenshot()`).
- Name collisions within a single `artifactEmit` return array
  (`[{name:"a.png", …}, {name:"a.png", …}]`) result in **last-write-wins**
  silently, since each item is written in turn to the same path. Ensure
  unique names yourself.

**Where files land:** `<runDir>/ext-<extname>/<name>`. Each emitted path is
appended to `handshake.artifacts[]` as `{ type: "ext-artifact", ext, path }`.

**Graceful-empty value:** return `null`, `undefined`, or `[]`. All skipped
silently.

**Wrong-shape penalty:** a non-array return records `bad-return`. Individual
items with invalid names / content types are skipped with stderr WARN but do
not record a failure record (they're logged, not tripped).

**Requires `ctx.runDir`:** if missing, the hook does not fire.

**Example:**

```js
import { chromium } from "playwright";

export async function artifactEmit(ctx) {
  if (!ctx?.devServerUrl || !ctx?.runDir) return [];
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  try {
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(ctx.devServerUrl, { timeout: 10_000 });
    const png = await page.screenshot();
    return [{ name: "homepage.png", content: png }];
  } catch {
    return [];  // degrade gracefully — see §6
  } finally {
    await browser.close();
  }
}
```

### 5.6 `startupCheck(ctx)` — load-time guard

Optional fifth hook. Fires **once at load time** from `loadExtensions()`, before
any capability matching. Throw to refuse to load. `ctx` is an empty object `{}`
at this call site.

```js
export async function startupCheck() {
  if (!process.env.API_KEY) {
    throw new Error("my-ext requires API_KEY env var");
  }
}
```

An optional extension whose `startupCheck` throws logs a WARN and is skipped
for the rest of the run. A **required** extension (listed in
`config.requiredExtensions`) whose `startupCheck` throws aborts the pipeline
with a FATAL error.

> Omitting `startupCheck` entirely is identical to exporting one that
> returns `undefined` — both succeed; the `✅ passed` line that
> `extension-test --all-hooks` prints for `startup.check` is
> **unconditional** (the return value is ignored by both the core and the
> CLI, §9). Export it only when you actually need the load-time guard.

---

## 6. Graceful degradation pattern

The golden rule: **never throw an uncaught error out of a hook**. The core
isolates you, but an empty-return skip is cleaner signal than a failure record.

Every well-behaved hook should handle three classes of environmental failure
by returning the hook's graceful-empty value (`""` for prompt, `[]` for
verdict/artifact, `undefined` for execute):

1. **External tool missing** — binary not on `PATH`, service not running.
2. **Unexpected file contents** — JSON parse failure, wrong shape.
3. **Slow / unavailable upstream** — network timeout.

**Copy-pasteable template:**

```js
import { spawnSync } from "node:child_process";
import { readFileSync, existsSync } from "node:fs";

// Cache CLI availability probe for the process lifetime.
let _cliCache = null;
function cliAvailable(bin) {
  if (_cliCache !== null) return _cliCache;
  const r = spawnSync("which", [bin], { encoding: "utf8", timeout: 1500 });
  _cliCache = r.status === 0;
  return _cliCache;
}

export async function promptAppend(ctx) {
  try {
    // (1) External tool missing → empty.
    if (!cliAvailable("my-tool")) return "";

    // (2) Input file missing / wrong shape → empty.
    const cfgPath = ctx?.flowDir ? `${ctx.flowDir}/my-ext.json` : null;
    if (!cfgPath || !existsSync(cfgPath)) return "";
    let cfg;
    try { cfg = JSON.parse(readFileSync(cfgPath, "utf8")); } catch { return ""; }
    if (!cfg || typeof cfg !== "object" || !Array.isArray(cfg.rules)) return "";

    // (3) Slow upstream → own timeout beats the core's 60s default.
    const r = spawnSync("my-tool", ["scan"], { encoding: "utf8", timeout: 3000 });
    if (r.status !== 0 || !r.stdout) return "";

    return `## my-ext\n\n${r.stdout.trim()}\n`;
  } catch (err) {
    // Last-resort catch — log, don't throw.
    process.stderr.write(`[my-ext] promptAppend degraded: ${err?.message || err}\n`);
    return "";
  }
}
```

**Why not throw and let the core handle it?** Because throwing increments the
failure streak toward the circuit breaker (§7.2) and writes a record to
`extension-failures.md`. That's the right behavior for bugs. For **expected**
environmental gaps (CLI not installed, offline mode) you want quiet no-op —
the user didn't ask you to fix their environment.

---

## 7. Timeout budgets & circuit breaker

### 7.1 Core-enforced timeout

Every hook invocation is wrapped with `withTimeout(fn, HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS)`. The
default is **60 seconds**, configurable via `OPC_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS`. If your
hook hasn't resolved in time, the core throws a tagged `HookTimeoutError`,
records a `timeout` failure, logs a stderr WARN, and moves on to the next
extension. The circuit breaker (§7.2) counts timeouts exactly like throws.

### 7.2 Circuit breaker

After **`HOOK_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`** consecutive failures (default **3**,
configurable via `OPC_HOOK_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`), the core sets
`ext.enabled = false` for the remainder of the process. A `_circuit_breaker`
disabled record is written to the failure sidecar and a CIRCUIT-BREAKER line
is logged to stderr:

```
[opc] CIRCUIT-BREAKER: extension 'my-ext' disabled after 3 consecutive failures (last: timeout in prompt.append)
```

Once disabled, the extension's hooks are skipped until the process exits (or
an orchestrator calls `resetExtension(ext)` after fixing the root cause).

Set `OPC_HOOK_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=0` to disable the breaker (failures are still
recorded, but the extension never auto-disables).

**Key semantics:**
- **Consecutive**, not cumulative — any successful invocation resets
  `_failStreak` to 0.
- For `artifactEmit`, the streak only resets if **every** emitted item's
  write succeeded. A per-item write failure prevents the reset.

### 7.3 Your responsibility

The core timeout is a **safety net**, not a budget. For extensions that call
external tools (`memex`, `curl`, `playwright`, etc.), **set your own timeout
inside the hook** and return the graceful-empty value if it trips. Common
budgets:

| External call         | Your timeout    | Reason                                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `which <bin>` probe   | 1.5 s           | Local — should be instant.                |
| Local CLI (e.g. grep) | 3 s             | Fast local work.                          |
| Headless browser nav  | 10 s            | Page load + one interaction.              |
| Total hook budget     | 20 s            | Leaves 3× slack under the 60 s core cap.  |

Own-timeout examples:

```js
// spawnSync timeout
spawnSync("memex", ["search", kw], { encoding: "utf8", timeout: 3000 });

// fetch timeout
await fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) });

// Playwright
await page.goto(url, { timeout: 10_000 });
```

### 7.4 Persistent breaker state (`.extension-state.json`)

The circuit breaker's `ext.enabled` / `ext._failStreak` / `ext.disabledReason`
are **persisted to disk** across CLI invocations within the same flow. This
matters because OPC is a short-lived-process CLI — without persistence, every
`opc-harness extension-verdict`, `prompt-context`, `extension-artifact` call
would start with a fresh in-memory registry and the breaker could never trip
across invocations.

**Location:** `<flow-dir>/.extension-state.json` (where `<flow-dir>` is
whatever you passed to `--dir`, typically `.harness`).

**Schema (v1):**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-19T10:30:00.000Z",
  "extensions": {
    "my-ext": {
      "enabled": false,
      "failStreak": 3,
      "disabledReason": "circuit_breaker: 3 consecutive failures"
    }
  }
}
```

**Lifecycle:**
- **Written** at the end of every `fire*` call when `flowDir` is configured.
  Atomic (tmp + rename) — no torn reads.
- **Read** by `loadExtensions({flowDir})` — applies `enabled=false` and
  streak state to extensions whose `name` matches. Unknown extensions in the
  file are ignored (no error).
- **Cleared** by `opc-harness init` — a fresh run starts with a clean slate.
  "Init == start over." If you want to preserve a tripped breaker across runs
  on purpose, don't re-init.
- **Bypass mode** (`--no-extensions`, `OPC_EXTENSIONS=disable`) does NOT
  load or persist breaker state — bypass is process-local by design.

**Forward-compat:** If `version` is missing or not `1`, the core logs a single
WARN to stderr and falls back to an empty state (does not crash). Corrupt JSON
is treated the same way. This lets future schema versions ship without
breaking older core binaries that encounter them. A v1 writer also **preserves
unknown top-level fields** on round-trip — so if a future v2 binary writes an
extra field, a v1 binary reading and re-saving the same file won't clobber it.

**Whitelist safety:** `saveBreakerState` does a read-modify-write: it
preserves entries for extensions that weren't loaded in the current
invocation. So `opc-harness extension-verdict --extensions foo` won't wipe
the breaker snapshot of `bar` that tripped in a previous run.

**Observability:** When `loadExtensions` restores one or more extensions to
`enabled=false` from the file, it prints a single stderr line naming them:

```
[opc] restored disabled state from .extension-state.json: foo, bar (use 'opc-harness init' to clear or set OPC_BREAKER_STATE=disabled)
```

If "my extension suddenly stopped firing", check this line first.

**Recovery**:
- `opc-harness init <dir>` — nuclear reset. Deletes `.extension-state.json`.
- `resetExtension(ext, registry)` — in-code recovery after fixing root
  cause. When `registry` is passed and has `_flowDir`, the reset is
  persisted to disk; without `registry`, only the in-memory `ext` is
  cleared and the next CLI invocation re-applies the disabled state.

**Escape hatch — `OPC_BREAKER_STATE=disabled`**: Turns off both load and
save. Useful for test suites that share a harness dir across scenarios and
want each scenario to see a fresh breaker state without `rm -f`ing the file
between them. Also handy during an extension-author debug cycle.

**Bypass mode** (`--no-extensions`, `OPC_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS=1`) does NOT
load or persist breaker state — bypass skips the entire extension system.
Selective bypass (`--extensions foo`) DOES load/save (see whitelist safety
above).

**Version control**: add `.extension-state.json` to your `.gitignore` — it's
runtime state, not source. For OPC flows, the whole `.harness/` dir is
already typically gitignored.

## 8. Failure sidecar — how your crashes surface

Every `prompt.append`, `verdict.append`, `execute.run`, `artifact.emit` failure
is recorded to `registry.failures[]` with this shape:

```js
{
  ext:     "my-ext",
  hook:    "prompt.append",
  kind:    "throw" | "timeout" | "bad-return" | "disabled",
  message: "…" /* first 500 chars of err.message */,
  at:      "2026-04-19T12:34:56.789Z",
}
```

When `runDir` is known (verdict/artifact phases, or promptContext on a node
with a latest run dir), the core writes two files:

### 8.1 `<runDir>/extension-failures.json` — source of truth

Machine-readable, cross-phase merged. Each CLI invocation in the same run dir
reads this file, unions its current failures (dedup on
`JSON.stringify([ext, hook, kind, message])`), and atomically rewrites it.

```json
{
  "failures": [
    { "ext": "my-ext", "hook": "prompt.append", "kind": "timeout",
      "message": "prompt.append timed out after 60000ms",
      "at": "2026-04-19T12:34:56.789Z" }
  ],
  "droppedTotal": 0
}
```

### 8.2 `<runDir>/extension-failures.md` — rendered view

Derived from the JSON sidecar, human/grep-readable:

```
# Extension Hook Failures

🟡 my-ext.prompt.append [timeout] prompt.append timed out after 60000ms @ 2026-04-19T12:34:56.789Z
🔴 other-ext._circuit_breaker [disabled] circuit-breaker tripped after 3 consecutive failures @ …
```

- 🔴 = `disabled` (circuit breaker tripped)
- 🟡 = `throw` | `timeout` | `bad-return`

The filename intentionally lacks the `eval-` prefix so evaluator-markdown
ingestion does not mistake infrastructure failures for role findings.

### 8.3 Cap & drops

`registry.failures[]` is capped at **200 entries** (overridable via
`OPC_HOOK_FAILURE_LOG_CAP`). Oldest entries are dropped FIFO; a running
`droppedTotal` is surfaced in both the JSON sidecar and the rendered
`> Note: N earlier failure record(s) dropped (cap=200).` line.

### 8.4 Strict mode

Setting `OPC_STRICT_EXTENSIONS=1` turns any recorded failure into a non-zero
process exit (code `2`) **after** the current phase has finished writing its
reports. Isolation is preserved — healthy siblings still produce output — but
CI builds fail loud instead of quiet.

---

## 9. `extension-test` CLI reference

```
opc-harness extension-test --ext <path> [--hook <hookname>] [--all-hooks] [--context <json>]
```

| Flag            | Type     | Default | Meaning                                                       |
|-----------------|----------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--ext <path>`  | required | —       | Path to the extension directory (containing `hook.mjs`).      |
| `--hook <name>` | optional | —       | Run a single hook by its kebab name: `prompt.append`, `verdict.append`, `execute.run`, `artifact.emit`, `startup.check`. |
| `--all-hooks`   | flag     | false   | Run every hook exported by the extension.                     |
| `--context <json>` | optional | `{}` | JSON string passed as `ctx` to each hook.                     |
| `--help`        | flag     | —       | Print usage to stderr and exit 0.                             |

**Behavior:**

1. Imports `hook.mjs`.
2. Runs `lintCapability` over `meta.provides` and `meta.compatibleCapabilities`,
   printing `[lint] ⚠️` lines for any failures.
3. Invokes each requested hook with the parsed `--context` object and prints
   a `✅ <hook>` / `❌ <hook>` line per hook.
4. Exits **0** even if individual hooks fail — `extension-test` is a lint
   command, not a pass-fail gate.
5. Non-zero exit is reserved for **load-time errors**: missing `--ext`, no
   `hook.mjs`, bad `--context` JSON, or neither `--hook` nor `--all-hooks`
   specified.

**What `extension-test` does and does NOT do:**

- `--all-hooks` runs exactly **three** hooks: `startup.check`,
  `prompt.append`, `verdict.append`. It does **not** run `execute.run` or
  `artifact.emit` — those need a live `runDir` and are exercised by the
  pipeline commands `extension-artifact` / `extension-verdict` against a
  real `.harness/` tree.
- To test `artifact.emit` via `extension-test`, pass `--hook artifact.emit`
  explicitly and put a writable `runDir` into `--context`. The command
  does **not** auto-create a tmpdir; if `runDir` is missing the hook
  short-circuits inside the core (see §5.5) and you'll see `✅` with no
  files written.
- `extension-test` calls your hook function **directly** (no `fire*Append`
  wrapper). The core timeout, circuit breaker, and failure sidecar are
  **not** exercised — a throw in your hook is reported as `❌` but no
  `extension-failures.md` is written. For end-to-end integration with
  those guards, use the pipeline commands below.
- Return values from `startupCheck` are ignored by the core (only throw vs
  not-throw matters); `extension-test` prints a generic `✅ passed` for
  `startup.check` regardless of what you return. Use the return value for
  your own diagnostic output if useful.
- `extension-test` does **not** run capability routing. `nodeCapabilities`
  in `--context` is passed through to your hook verbatim, but the CLI
  invokes every requested hook **unconditionally** once it's exported
  (see `ext-commands.mjs:213-222`). It does **not** evaluate
  `ctx.nodeCapabilities ∩ (provides ∪ compatibleCapabilities)`. To
  observe the routing rule (§4.5) in action, use the pipeline commands
  (`prompt-context`, `extension-verdict`, `extension-artifact`) — they
  go through `firePromptAppend` / `fireVerdictAppend` / `fireArtifactEmit`
  which do enforce the intersection check.

**Output format per hook** (stdout — grep-friendly):

- `startup.check` → `[startup.check] ✅ passed (Nms)`
- `prompt.append` → `[prompt.append] ✅ returned N chars (Nms)`, followed
  by a preview block (first 200 chars) when the return is non-empty:
  ```
    --- output preview ---
    <first 200 chars, newlines re-indented by two spaces>
    ---------------------
  ```
- `verdict.append` → `[verdict.append] ✅ returned N findings (Nms)`,
  followed by one indented line per finding:
  ```
    <severity> [<category>] <message>
  ```
  **`severity` is the literal lowercase word (`error` / `warning` /
  `info`) — NOT the 🔴/🟡/🔵 emoji. The `file` field is not echoed.**
  Emoji appear only in `eval-extensions.md`, which is written by
  `fireVerdictAppend` inside the pipeline commands (see §5.3 table).
  To see emoji output, run `opc-harness extension-verdict …` against a
  real `.harness/` tree and read `<runDir>/eval-extensions.md`.
- `execute.run` / `artifact.emit` / any other hook →
  `[<hook>] ✅ result: <JSON.stringify(result)>`
- A thrown hook → `[<hook>] ❌ error: <err.message>` (the CLI still
  exits 0; only load-time errors cause non-zero exit).

> **Noise note (G5).** If you see `⚠️  ~/.claude/flows/ is deprecated —
> use --flow-file instead. Found: <files>` on stderr during
> `extension-test`, that banner is unrelated to your extension. It comes
> from the global flow-template bootstrap in `flow-templates.mjs` and

**Examples:**

```bash
# Lint + run all hooks with an empty context.
opc-harness extension-test --ext ./my-ext --all-hooks

# Run only promptAppend with a realistic context.
opc-harness extension-test \
  --ext ./my-ext \
  --hook prompt.append \
  --context '{"task":"build signup page","nodeCapabilities":["context-enrichment@1"],"role":"builder"}'

# Verify startup check only.
opc-harness extension-test --ext ./my-ext --hook startup.check
```

**Related pipeline commands** (these run your extensions inside a real flow):

```
opc-harness prompt-context     --node <id> --role <role> --dir <harness-dir>
opc-harness extension-verdict  --node <id>               --dir <harness-dir>
opc-harness extension-artifact --node <id>               --dir <harness-dir>
opc-harness config resolve     [--dir <p>]
```

All three pipeline commands accept the bypass flags `--no-extensions` (disable
every extension for this invocation) and `--extensions a,b` (whitelist only
the named extensions). `config resolve` prints the merged OPC config with
its `_source` map so you can debug why a given option won.

## 10. Full minimal example — memex-recall

The reference "smallest real extension" ships at
`~/.claude/skills/opc/examples/extensions/memex-recall/`. Reading it end-to-end
is the fastest way to internalize every pattern this guide teaches.

### 10.1 `ext.json`

```json
{
  "name": "memex-recall",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "promptAppend hook that enriches review/build prompts with 1-3 relevant Zettelkasten notes via `memex search`. Graceful no-op when memex CLI is absent.",
  "meta": {
    "provides": ["context-enrichment@1"],
    "compatibleCapabilities": ["verification@1", "execute@1", "design-review@1"]
  }
}
```

### 10.2 `hook.mjs` — structure walkthrough

```js
import { spawnSync } from "node:child_process";

  provides: ["context-enrichment@1"],
  compatibleCapabilities: ["verification@1", "execute@1", "design-review@1"],
};

const TOTAL_BUDGET_MS  = 6000;    // hard cap across all searches
const MAX_KEYWORDS     = 5;
const MAX_RESULTS      = 3;

// Cache the `which memex` result for the process lifetime — avoid

### 10.3 What to notice

- **No throws.** Every failure path returns `""`.
- **Own timeouts.** `spawnSync` gets `timeout: 3000`; the outer loop has a
  `TOTAL_BUDGET_MS` deadline; the core's 60 s safety net is never hit.
- **Versioned capabilities.** `context-enrichment@1` — no bare-name warning.
- **Compatible capabilities.** Still matches older `verification@1`,
  `execute@1`, `design-review@1` nodes during migration.
- **Defensive ctx access.** `ctx?.task || ctx?.taskDescription || …` — no
  crash when a caller omits a field.
- **Cheap reload.** `cliAvailable()` caches its probe; module re-import
  during dev doesn't hammer `which`.

Copy this structure. Rename. Ship.

## Change log

U4.1r → U4.1 fix-pair. Entries tagged with originating reviewer + finding ID.

- **[A1]** Added §0 Prerequisites: `npm i -g @touchskyer/opc` install vs
  `node bin/opc-harness.mjs` fallback, sanity-check command.
- **[A2]** Added §0 `~/.opc/` bootstrap paragraph: directory is not required
  to pre-exist, `OPC_EXTENSIONS_DIR` override, no other scaffolding needed.
- **[A3 + friction-§5-mapping]** Added §1.2 hook name mapping table
  (camelCase ↔ kebab+dot), explicit duplicate-export precedence (kebab
  wins), unknown-export silent-ignore rule.
- **[B1]** Added §1.1 Execution model: sequential per call site,
  alphabetical ordering (with `config.extensionOrder` override), sibling
  isolation on throw, no cross-call-site ordering guarantee.
- **[B2]** Added §1.1 `ctx` mutability paragraph: shared reference, do not
  mutate, treat as read-only.
- **[B3]** Added §4.1 "No semver" paragraph: integer generations only,
  explicit examples of what fails lint.
- **[B4]** Rewrote §5.3 wrong-shape paragraph: explicit checklist of what
  passes the validation predicate, "dropped with no failure record"
  stated, debug guidance.
- **[A-friction §5 title]** Retitled §5 from "The 4 hooks" to "The hooks",
  stated 4-per-node + 1-load-time.
- **[A-friction execution model]** Covered by §1.1 (in-process, full Node
  privileges, `process.exit` kills harness).
- **[A-friction timeout cooperative]** §1.1 now states cooperative-timeout
  semantics explicitly: in-flight subprocesses/promises keep running.
- **[A-friction no matching ext]** §4.5 now documents silent no-op when no
  extension matches + debugging commands.
- **[A-friction case sensitivity]** §4.5 now states case-sensitive exact
  equality + lint failure = never-matches.
- **[A-friction extension-test artifactEmit]** §9 now has a "does and does
  NOT do" block: `--all-hooks` only covers 3 hooks; `artifact.emit` needs
  explicit `--hook` + `runDir`; no auto-tmpdir; timeouts/breaker not
  exercised.
- **[A-friction startupCheck return]** §9 block states return value is
  ignored; `extension-test` prints generic pass regardless.
- **[A-friction multi-ext ordering]** Covered by §1.1 (alphabetical) +
  §5.5 note on intra-emit collisions.
- **[B-friction binary types]** §5.5 content list expanded: explicit
  supported types, explicit unsupported types (ArrayBuffer, Blob,
  ReadableStream, unawaited Promise), name-collision last-write-wins
  rule.
- **[B-friction backslash]** §5.5 notes POSIX basename treats `\` as
  literal character.

Deliberately deferred (need speculation beyond current source):

- **[B-friction error-vs-empty decision rule]** A categorical throw-vs-return
  rule is editorial advice that the source cannot confirm; §6 already
  enumerates three environmental classes. Future Run 4 lesson-learned pass
  may formalize.
- **[B-friction unit-test story]** No `makeTestRegistry` / `makeTestCtx`
  helper exists in source; documenting an imagined API would be invention.
  Authors can build their own with the Appendix B exports.
- **[B-friction sidecar schema version]** The code does not emit a
  `schemaVersion` field today; promising one would misrepresent current
  behavior. Future-proofing left to a real schema-evolution change.
- **[B-friction breaking-change policy]** SemVer commitments for the public
  surface require coordination with the packaging story; out of scope for
  a docs patch.
- **[B-friction breaker per-item trail]** Current source records per-item
  WARNs but not sidecar entries — existing behavior documented, policy
  change deferred.
- **[A-nit circuit-breaker-reset / Appendix B import path / timeout-table
  advisory]** Left unchanged — editorial nits that don't block newcomer
  first-hour success.

## Lessons from Run 4 outsider-build

Run 4 validated this guide by having an outsider agent (read: the doc + the
starter template, nothing else) build `lint-prompt-length`. The following
gaps were caught by the outsider or the two reviewers and patched in this
revision.

### G1 — severity → emoji mapping
- **Before:** §5.3 showed rendered emojis in an example block but never stated the mapping.
- **After:** explicit table in §5.3 (`error→🔴`, `warning→🟡`, `info→🔵`, else→🔵) with a source pointer to `extensions.mjs` `fireVerdictAppend`.

### G2 — `extension-test` stdout format
- **Before:** §9 said "prints a ✅ `<hook>` / ❌ `<hook>` line per hook" and stopped there.
- **After:** §9 now has an "Output format per hook" subsection documenting each hook's exact stdout: `startup.check` fixed `✅ passed`, `prompt.append` with preview block, `verdict.append` findings as literal `  <severity> [<category>] <message>` — no emoji, no `file`.

### G3 — `ext.json.name` field
- **Before:** §3.2 example had `"name": "memex-recall"` and prose only said "descriptive only".
- **After:** §3.2 explicitly states `name` is cosmetic; directory name always wins; starter omits it deliberately; both styles are legal.

### G4 — `meta.name` on `hook.mjs` exports
- **Before:** every example meta had `name: "…"`; no statement on whether it was required.
- **After:** §3.3 has a callout: `meta.name` is not read by the loader; omit it; example `name:` fields remain for historical reasons only.

### G5 — `~/.claude/flows/` deprecation banner on `extension-test` stderr
- **Before:** undocumented harness-wide noise; newcomers assumed it was their fault.
- **After:** §9 has a "Noise note" explaining the banner comes from `flow-templates.mjs`, is unrelated to extensions, and can be silenced with `OPC_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`. Appendix A now lists that env var.

### MG1 — §9 self-contradiction on capability routing
- **Before:** one bullet said `extension-test` calls hooks directly (no `fire*Append` wrapper); another invited you to remove `nodeCapabilities` from `--context` to "feel the routing rule". The second was false — `ext-commands.mjs:213-222` invokes hooks unconditionally.
- **After:** replaced the misleading bullet with an explicit statement that `extension-test` does **not** run routing; use the pipeline commands (`prompt-context` / `extension-verdict` / `extension-artifact`) to exercise §4.5.

### MG2 — `ctx.task` type contract under `extension-test --context`
- **Before:** §5.1 documented `ctx.task` as string; §9 didn't warn that `--context <json>` is passed through verbatim.
- **After:** §5.1 now warns: pipeline commands guarantee a string (possibly `""`), but `extension-test --context` can send `undefined` / `42` / arrays / objects. Prefer a `typeof task === "string"` guard over `?? ""` for any schema-typed field.

### Reviewer A unlogged (A) — no catalog of canonical core capabilities
- **Before:** §4.4 used an abstract `visual-check@1/@2` example; §10.1 showed the `verification@1 / design-review@1 / execute@1` triple without labelling it. Authors cargo-culted.
- **After:** new §4.7 "Canonical core capabilities" tabulates the capability strings stamped by `flow-templates.mjs` built-ins plus the widely-reused generic triple.

### Reviewer A unlogged (B) — `ctx.task` ≠ assembled prompt
- **Before:** §5.1 typed `task` as "task description" without contrasting it with the assembled prompt. Outsider building a "lint prompt length" hook silently equated the two.
- **After:** §5.1 states there is no `ctx.assembledPrompt`; a hook cannot observe downstream concatenation of `promptAppend` outputs. Measure the inputs, or emit the finding from inside `promptAppend` via a stderr side-channel.

### Reviewer A unlogged (C) — `startupCheck` return-value wording
- **Before:** §5.6 was silent on whether omitting `startupCheck` differed from returning `undefined`; §9 said return is ignored.
- **After:** §5.6 adds a callout that omitting the hook is identical to returning `undefined`; the `✅ passed` emoji is unconditional.

|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OPC_EXTENSIONS_DIR`              | `~/.claude/skills/opc-extension`            | Directory scanned for extension subdirs.                                |
| `OPC_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS`             | `60000`                        | Core safety-net timeout per hook invocation.                            |
| `OPC_HOOK_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`      | `3`                            | Consecutive failures before circuit breaker trips (`0` disables).       |

| `OPC_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS`          | unset                          | `1` → load zero extensions (benchmark mode).                            |
| `OPC_STRICT_EXTENSIONS`           | unset                          | `1` → exit code `2` if any failure was recorded this process.           |
| `OPC_BREAKER_STATE`               | unset                          | `disabled` → skip all load/save of `.extension-state.json` (§7.4).      |
| `OPC_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS`          | unset                          | `1` → silence the once-per-process `⚠️  ~/.claude/flows/ is deprecated …` banner emitted by `flow-templates.mjs`. |

## Appendix B — Public exports from `extensions.mjs`

Useful for authoring tests or orchestrator glue code:

| Export                         | Purpose                                                       |

That's the full public surface. Anything not listed here is internal — don't
depend on it.
